Have I mentioned how much I love [John Crickett's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/) [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/)? In this post, I cover the completion of my 2nd coding challenge, an implementation (in Python) of the unix/Unix command-line tool `head`.

## About
`py-head` is my version of the Unix-style command-line tool named `head`. It is a command-line tool that displays the first `n` lines or `c` bytes of a file, where the user can provide the value for `n` and `c`. If no file or value for `n` or `c` is provided, then it displays the first 10 lines from the standard input.

Similar to my `py-wc` project, I decided to code this up in Python since that's the language I'm most familiar with. This allowed me to focus more on the workflow of `head` and less on the syntax of the language I was working with.

## Instructions
To use this as a command-line tool, I recommend adding the finished script to PATH / system variables. For Windows, create a folder named `Aliases` in your C drive: `C:/Aliases`, and then add this folder to PATH. Next, create a batch file that will execute when you call the specified alias. For example, on my machine, I have a batch file named `head.bat` located at `C:/Aliases`, that contains the following script:

```bat
@echo off
echo.
python C:\...\GitHub\py-head\main.py %*
```

So now, when I type `head` in the command prompt, this batch file will execute, which in turn, runs the `py-head` Python script. 

## Examples

`py-head` allows you to execute typical Unix-style `head` commands. If no flags are included with the filename, it prints the entire file contents:

```cmd
C:\> head hello.txt
hello, world!
```

```cmd
C:\> head small.txt

most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

before using this eBook.
```

If no file is included, it displays the first 10 lines from standard input:

```cmd
C:\> head
Some text that I entered
Some text that I entered
line 2
line 2
line 3
line 3
this is line 4
this is line 4
now this is line 5
now this is line 5
hello
hello
world
world
this is line 8
this is line 8
line 9
line 9
10!
10!
```

We can also specify and display only the first `n` lines (note that you can list the flag in any order):

```cmd
C:\> head small.txt -n3

This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
```

```cmd
C:\> head small.txt -n 3
The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Art of War

This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
```

```cmd
C:\> head -n3 small.txt 
The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Art of War

This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
```

```cmd
C:\> head -n 3 small.txt 
The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Art of War

This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
```

And we can also specify and display only the first `c` bytes:

```cmd
C:\> head large.txt -c243

We can also pass in multiple files

```cmd
C:\> head hello.txt small.txt hello.txt 
==> hello.txt <==
hello, world!

==> small.txt <==

before using this eBook.

==> hello.txt <==
hello, world!
```

```cmd
C:\> head hello.txt hello.txt hello.txt hello.txt
==> hello.txt <==
hello, world!

==> hello.txt <==
hello, world!

==> hello.txt <==
hello, world!

==> hello.txt <==
hello, world!
```

And finally, we can pass in multiple files, along with the `n` or `c` flag:

```cmd
C:\> head hello.txt hello.txt hello.txt hello.txt -c9
==> hello.txt <==
hello, wo

==> hello.txt <==
hello, wo

==> hello.txt <==
hello, wo

==> hello.txt <==
hello, wo
```

```cmd
C:\> head large.txt small.txt hello.txt -n 7
==> large.txt <==

## Libraries
Just like the `py-wc` project, everything I needed for `py-head` was included in Python's Standard Library. Some basic I/O with Python's built-in `open` function, command-line parsing with the `argparse` library, and some directory navigation with `os`.

If you've never used [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), I highly recommend it for handling parsing of command-line inputs for programs, here's an example from my repo for this project:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create an ArgumentParser object
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process text file(s).')

    # Add arguments for input file(s)
    parser.add_argument(
        'input_files', 
        nargs='*',  # 0 or more input files
        type=str,
        default=[],
        help='Path to the input file(s). Pass no options with input file to print out the contents of the entire file. Pass no file to read from user input.'
    )

    # Create a mutually exclusive group for -c and -n flags
    group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group()

    # Add flags for different options to the mutually exclusive group created above
    group.add_argument('-c', '--bytes', type=int, default=None, help='Print bytes')
    group.add_argument('-n', '--lines', type=int, default=None, help='Print lines')

    # Parse the command-line arguments
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # more code below...
```
